# THE DISTEACHER

Do you like distorted guitar music but you have never undestood how do guitarists obtain that sound? Well, our project is here to help you!

With our application, the Disteacher, you will learn in an interactive way what are different types of distortion and which parameters influence the output sound.

Using our app is very easy and intuitive: you just need to launch it and you will be presented a choice between the two main usage modes, "Tutorial Mode" or "I can do it Mode". To start using the Disteacher the best thing is to select the Tutorial mode: this modality is specifically thought to make you build some confidence in the usage of the interface. On the left you can select one of the different inputs: you can choose a Sinusoid at a frequency of 20 Hz, to see the input and the resulting distorted output.

Right in the middle of the GUI window you will notice four knobs: they are the heart of our application! You can play with them as much as you like. They are there to help you understand how do those parameters influence the output sound.

Do you need some help to boost your imagination? We also added three buttons to help you get started with three different distortion pre-sets, inspired by the sound of three famous guitarists: we have the "Overdrive Effect", that we associated to Stevie Ray Vaughan; then there is the pure "Distortion" effect, characteristic of the AC/DC band; and then we have the toughest of them all, the "Fuzz Effect", and we linked it to Matt Bellamy from the band Muse.

When you have understood the functioning of the Disteacher you can switch to "I can do it" Mode just by clicking on the top right button! There you may see the distortion effect acting on the input of your computer microphone or even of your external soundcard, if you wish.

So, feel free to experiment and have fun!
